<ul>
<li>Acted as lead developer on an internal development framework designed to facilitate rapid, standards-based LOB application development. The framework is packaged and deployed to solutions internally via NuGet, and includes a common data access & logging layer, easily consumable UI components exposed by Html Helpers & strongly-typed Razor templates, extensions to and wrappers around the Kendo UI framework, and various JavaScript utilities. 
<br /><b>Key technologies:</b> MVC5, C# 5.0, Web API, Kendo UI, jQuery, CSS, Entity Framework, Microsoft Enterprise Library, NuGet.
</li>
<br />
<li>Acted as liaison between IT Architecture and the New York development teams, ensuring and aiding the adherence to corporate architecture guidelines. This role required guidance and mentoring of teammates inexperienced with the MVC pattern and JavaScript (predominantly jQuery), as well as the reviewing of initial application designs. 
<ul><li>As New York’s liaison, I also was member of a virtual development team comprised of representatives from offices around the country, including Atlanta, Windsor, Scottsdale, and New York, in which we collectively designed and developed enhancements to shared enterprise class libraries.</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Worked directly with several areas of the business (including compliance, portfolio managers, traders, accounting, and risk management) in delivering mission-critical applications and in addressing regulatory & internal reporting requirements. These business-oriented projects included:
  <ul>
    <li>Building a new frontend for Cash Management, used across all functional areas, which interfaces with custodian data, transfer agent data, and third party order management systems (Blackrock Aladdin and Charles River).  A widely-used feature of the application is the ability to drill down into any calculated amount displayed on a grid, showing its calculated components down to the holdings and transactions level, as well as the ability to restrict access to specific accounts for compliance reasons. It serves not only as a cash master view, but also provides an auditable doer-approver workflow around the approving of cash flows, the creating/approving of cash adjustments, and the triggering of both to flow downstream.   While aiding in database design, I was the sole frontend developer. 
    <br /><b>Key technologies:</b> MVC2, C# 3.0, Telerik Extensions for MVC, jQuery, CSS, Enterprise Library DAAB, SQL Server 2010, Tidal Enterprise Scheduler.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>Building a new frontend for the maintenance of compliance rules that are tested against Put and Call option orders, and the reporting of their triggered alerts and warnings. 
    <br /><b>Key technologies:</b> MVC2, C# 3.0, MvcContrib, jQuery, jQuery UI, CSS, Enterprise Library DAAB, SSRS, SQL.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>Developing risk analysis and regulatory reports, including the analysis of derivatives exposure and holdings extracts for 13f and 13g reporting. 
    <br /><b>Key Technologies:</b> SSRS 2008, SQL.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>Aiding in the maintenance and support of the Charles River OMS, including analysis and testing of an upgrade from V6 to V9, and making enhancements to the overnight trade roll, which required the amending of late orders placed on foreign exchanges during NYSE hours - taking into account differences in time zone and exchange-specific holidays.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>Porting/rewriting several legacy WinForms applications to MVC. 
    <br /><b>Key technologies:</b> MVC2, C# 3.0, MvcContrib, jQuery, jQuery UI, CSS, Enterprise Library DAAB.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Assisted in the overnight support of proprietary feeds between front, middle, and back offices, and in the support of feeds from financial data vendors. The support responsibilities required the collaboration with offshore support teams residing in India, providing them guidance and next-step instructions when necessary.
<br /><b>Key technologies:</b> Tidal Enterprise Scheduler, SQL.
